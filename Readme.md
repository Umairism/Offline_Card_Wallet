## Overview

Offline Card Wallet is an offline-first, privacy-focused digital wallet for storing and using payment, loyalty, and membership cards. Unlike commercial apps, it does not require an internet connection and is intended for personal use and experimentation.

---

## Features

- **Secure Card Storage**: Add cards manually or via camera scan. Data is encrypted locally using AES-256 and protected by PIN or biometric authentication.
- **Tap-to-Pay (NFC, Android only)**: Experimental Host Card Emulation (HCE) lets you simulate card payments at supported NFC terminals.
- **QR Payments**: Scan merchant QR codes for payments or generate QR codes to share card/transaction details.
- **Loyalty & Membership Cards**: Store and display non-banking cards (loyalty, membership, ID barcodes) for easy checkout.
- **Transaction Logs**: Maintain a local, offline history of all QR/NFC interactions.
- **Offline Operation**: All features work without internet access.
- **Multi-language Support**: Easily switch between languages for global usability.
- **Dark Mode**: User-friendly interface with dark mode support.
- **Card Backup & Restore**: Export/import encrypted card data for device migration.
- **Customizable Card Categories**: Organize cards by type, color, or tags.
- **Cross-Platform Sync (Planned)**: Securely sync cards between devices using encrypted local transfer.
- **Accessibility Features**: High-contrast mode, screen reader support, and large text options.
